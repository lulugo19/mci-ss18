## ms3

**date of delivery: 25.07.2018**

- [ ] **All:** check for inconsitencies 

- [ ] **All:** correct ms2 (current phase)

- [ ] **All:** implement prototype (next phase, *but can already start*)

- [ ] **All:** prototype should contain corrections from the milestone appointment (marked in this
               document with **CORRECTIONS IN MS3 PROTOTYPE**) and the info we gained from the 
               videos from the paperprototype. That means our wireframes should not be corrected,
               instead we should do the corrections directly in the prototype.
