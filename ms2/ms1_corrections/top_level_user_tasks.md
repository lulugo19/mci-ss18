# Top Level User Tasks

## Description 

The Top Level User Tasks should give us a comprehensive insight into
the main use cases our users will try to fullfill. Each Top Level
User Task represents the root of a task tree in the Hierarchical Task 
Analysis.

## Top level user tasks

  - lend transponder
  
  - give/remove permission
  
  - verify lender's permission
  
  - (?) check for available transponder

## Conclusion

This list is a very raw representation of our users' tasks, but gives us a
great starting point for our Hierarchical Task Analysis.
