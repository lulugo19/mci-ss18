## Andreas Fischer (doorman)

Andreas Fischer works as a doorman at the TH Köln in Gummersbach. In general he really likes his job.
He has a lot to do with people and there is always something going on.
But he sometimes struggles with the paperwork he needs to do during his work day.
Especially the lending of transponders causes him headaches sometimes. The permission lists need frequent editorial work
and this is very time consuming and error-prone. Also when there is somebody who want to lend a transponder, which happens quite often a day, 
he need to search in these huge lists and this is causing him stress, because people can be quite impatient sometimes.
He works at the faculty for computer and engineering science and in general the building is techically very well equipped, 
so he wonders why there is no technical system that helps him with his problem.
Luckily he heard about a student project, that tries to come up with a design-solution for his problem.
He hopes that the project will move in the right direction and that there will be something soon, that supports him at work, 
so he can concentrate on more important aspects of his work.

Andreas wants:
- to look up permissions for transponders and the availability of transponders uncomplicated and fast 
- he don't want to manage the permission lists by hand
- he wants a system that is less error-prone and let him quickly lend transponders to people

## Prof. Dr. Siegelbud
Prof. Dr. Siegelbud is a professor for communication and network technology at the TH Köln in Gummersbach.
This semester he supervises the master-project of some students. The students need access to the laboratories, 
so he needs to give them permissions to lend the corresponding transponders that can open the rooms.
So he needs to go down to the doorman, where he needs to authorize and give the doorman the list of students, that need access
to the laboratories. He is very busy with other things, so this is quite inconvinient for him. His to-do-list has already stacked
up higher than he would normally allow it. It would be much easier if he just could give the permissions straight from his desk.

Prof. Dr. Siegelbud wants:
- to give permissions for transponders (rooms) to people right at his desk (or anywhere)
- to look up the permissions he gave (also at his desk or anywhere)
- to remove permissions in the same easy manner

## Sandra Meyer (master-student)
Sandra Meyer is a master-student and currently in her third semester. For her master-project about IT-Security she needs to
access the laboratories several times a week. She has spoken with her supervisor Prof. Dr. Siegelbud, who already gave her access.
Everytime she goes in the laboratories she goes to the doorman in the lobby. There she waits for the doorman to check her permissions
and give her the transponder, that let her open the room. Quite often the transponder was already lent, which is impratical for her
because the laboratories are located in the opposite direction of the lobby, so it always takes her a while to get her there.
The lending of transponders also takes a while. She feels sorry for the doorman, because he needs to work through some 
confusing lists, but she also wishes sometimes, that the process would be faster.
It's not much time the process takes, but it is stacking up and she really could use this time for her studies.

Sandra wants:
- that the process of lending a transponder is faster
- that she can look beforehand whether a transponder is lent or not
