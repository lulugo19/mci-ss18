and can perform the necessary actions if transponders are missing for a too long time.

4. As a gatekeeper, I can lend transponders to people without much administrative effort, so I don't have to manage huge lists 
and the persons who want the transponders are happy.

## for the persons in charge of rooms
1. As a person in charge of a room, I can give/remove permissions to other people for lending transponders to open the 
rooms I am in charge of, in an easy and quick way, so I don't have to go anywhere to do this and persons I trust can open the rooms, 
I am responsible for.

## for lenders
1. As a lender, I can lend a transponder to open a room without much effort, so I can open rooms with it. 

2. As a lender, I can look beforehand whether a transponder is already lent or not, so I save time and I only lend
a transponder if it is available.
