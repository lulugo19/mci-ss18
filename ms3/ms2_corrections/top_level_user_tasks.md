# Top Level User Tasks

## Description 

The Top Level User Tasks should give us a comprehensive insight into
the main tasks our users will try to fullfill when using our application. 
Each Top Level User Task represents the root of a task tree in the 
Hierarchical Task Analysis. All tasks combined should make every User
Story possible to accomplish.

## Top level user tasks

  - borrow transponder
  
  - give/remove permission
  
  - verify borrower's permission
  
  - check for available transponder
  
  - check if I have permission to room/transponder
  
  - ask for permission

## Conclusion

This list is a very raw representation of our users' tasks, but gives us a
great starting point for our Hierarchical Task Analysis.

## Revision

Added description and conclusion, added tasks 3 - 5.
